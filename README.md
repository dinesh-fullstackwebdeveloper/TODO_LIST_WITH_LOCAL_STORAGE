# CRUD Application with Local Storage

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage an array of objects representing user data, stored persistently in the browser's Local Storage. The project also includes a live demonstration hosted on Netlify.
